        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Turing's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born on June 23, 1912 in Maida Vale, London.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1926</strong> - Alan Turing first showed signs of intelligence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1931-1934</strong> -  Studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1936</strong> -  Studied mathematics and cryptology while also building three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at Princeton University.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939</strong> - Helped to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1940</strong> - Was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> -Traveled to the United States to work with the US naval cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington.
          </li>
          <li>1946</strong> - He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had presented the first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1947</strong> -  Lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1948</strong> - Was appointed a position in the mathematics department at the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers. Created the LU decomposition method that was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1950</strong> - The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1952</strong> - Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" was published in 1952 which was all about his interest in the biology of organisms.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1954</strong> - Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him dead.
          </li>
        </ul>

            "A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human,"
          </p>
          <cite>-- Turing wrote in 1950 defining his now-famous Turing Test</cite>
